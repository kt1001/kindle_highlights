The bottom dropped out of Doris’ world and her idyll was shattered. ‘It was the only ambition I ever had,’ she said. ‘Not to be a dancer or Hollywood movie star but to be a housewife in a good marriage.’ She would go on to achieve one ambition with flying colours but sadly the other one would pass her by, largely on account of her own bad choices in men.

Fred Foster was unceremoniously dumped and when Jorden asked her to marry him, she agreed. The ceremony, she said, would take place as soon as she turned 18. For the second time in less than a year (the third, had her relationship with Foster been consummated), Doris risked becoming a subpoenaed witness in a statutory rape case.

Henceforth, wherever she appeared, Doris would get a cable or telephone call and on 6 February 1941 in New York Jorden surprised her by turning up at the recording studio where she had just cut ‘Anapola’, her first shellac disc with Les Brown (one of 12 sides and the only one which appears to have survived) and asked her to marry him.

Following this, Doris informed Les Brown that she was leaving the band to get married. With Al Jorden there was absolutely no compromise: a wife’s place was in the home or hanging around hotel rooms with other orchestra wives. Les and Alma, together with several other friends, advised Doris against the union (correctly, as it turned out).

Jorden’s housewarming gift was a dog–a deliberate play on Doris’ emotions because he knew how fond she was of animals. He fussed over the dog, insisting it should sleep on their bed while Terry was farmed out to Alma. If the child cried during the night, Doris was prohibited from going in to comfort him and if she disobeyed he rewarded her with a swift backhander.

This incident resulted in her being let go from The Pepsodent Show and replaced by Doris, already described in newspaper columns as ‘The Girl Next Door’, though had the journalists known more about her, they might have argued that this particular girl-next-door suffered more traumas in the last few years than might have been considered appropriate for her ‘wholesome’ image.

The couple spent one last night together, wherein Weidler told Doris he had never loved her–though this did not prevent her from having sex with him. ‘I could not doubt his strong desire for me,’ she later observed, ‘But I guess his desire not to be Mr Doris Day was even stronger.’ The next morning there was an amicable parting of the ways. The couple had been married less than eight months though their divorce proceedings were to drag on for some time on account of Doris’ persistent attempts to be reconciled with him.

Hoping to add a touch of Method to her performance in the remake, Marty Melcher told Doris to imagine this was a real-life situation and that Terry had been abducted rather than her 9-year-old on-screen son.

Melcher’s attitude towards his wife and stepson appears to have taken a turn for the worse by this stage. In her memoirs Doris denies that he was physically violent towards her, claiming the nearest he ever got to this was slamming his fist into the wall or door but friends and acquaintances (such as Rock Hudson) have said that he knocked her about. He certainly did hit Terry

and often humiliated him in public, calling him ‘sissy’ or ‘delinquent’. When Doris complained that he was being too hard on the boy, Melcher’s response was that as the man of the household, he alone was responsible for disciplining Terry. To prove a point, he consulted the oracle–the Broones–who pointed out to her that it was against the edicts of Christian Science to have parents pulling in opposite directions as far as the wellbeing of their children was concerned. ‘When the house is divided, it falls,’ Mary Baker Eddy decreed, which Melcher interpreted as not having to spare the rod to spoil the child.

Melcher and Terry were unhurt, but Doris suffered whiplash injuries and severe bruising. Because the shooting schedule for Julie was so tight, Melcher would not allow her to stay in hospital overnight for observation and after an X-ray, she was forced to discharge herself.

Doris checked herself into the Glendale Memorial Hospital, where surgeons discovered an intestinal tumour weighing almost two pounds. During the subsequent four-hour operation, it was found necessary to reconstruct her small intestine and perform a hysterectomy.

The dilemma with Nick Adams–or rather Gable’s reluctance to work with him until he was talked into it by Doris–stemmed from the young actor’s position among Hollywood’s so-called ‘open-secret’ closeted gay community; the fact that Adams appeared aware of all its murky past and present including Gable’s own dalliances on the other side of the fence.

Commenting in Doris’ memoirs on Melcher’s double-standards and his inability to cope with his son being a normal teenager, Terry observed, ‘He became hell-bent on making me feel guilty and in trying to run my life like a drill sergeant. He was all holier-than-thou in his Christian Science uniform, ushering on Sundays, and proverbs came out of him at me like machine-gun bullets. “Do as I say, not as I do,” which means I get my ass kicked for something he also does but he doesn’t get his ass

This made Rock angry: his own father had treated him badly and he could not bear this in others. He advised Doris to bring Terry home but as usual she listened only to her Christian Science advisers–Melcher and the Broones. What Hudson was also unaware of was that, after a heated row with Ross Hunter over Melcher’s appointment, Henry Willson enforced a deal with Universal wherein he would pocket $25,000–to be deducted from his client’s salary–for his role as Rock’s ‘adviser’.

Terry, now 20, begged his mother to slam the door in Melcher’s face when he returned to North Crescent Drive with his tail firmly between his legs. What made matters infinitely worse was that he was less interested in making amends for his abominable behaviour than warning Doris that if she divorced him, she would effectively be shooting herself in the foot because their finances were so inextricably linked that should they part permanently, the only outcome would be the bankruptcy court. She was naive enough to swallow the story and so Melcher moved back into their home. The brief separation, however, had enabled her to at last gather her senses and now she laid the law down. She was the breadwinner in the family and, as such, entitled to some respect. From now on, she would make all the decisions about her movies and recording career.

Hospital staff were instructed that Melcher’s business partner Jerry Rosenthal should not be allowed into the sickroom nor should any calls be put through to him, which suggests Doris must have already suspected their dealings may not have been strictly legitimate.

Terry pulled no punches when he observed of his stepfather’s untimely death: ‘It wasn’t going to ruin my Christmas,’ adding of Melcher’s mania for making money, ‘but I had figured he wouldn’t allow himself to die until he had at least a hundred million stashed under the bed someplace.’ Though Terry hated him for the way he had bullied his family he did not consider him a crook. ‘Although I figured Marty was rather fucked up,’ he observed in Doris’ memoirs, ‘I always rated him as honest. Because how else was he able to live up to all those lofty Christian Science goals?’

Now it emerged that Marty had also duped his own stepson, urging Terry to hand over royalties from his own compositions and production deals to Rosenthal for safe investment. Doris first learned of the scam when she dropped in at Melcher’s office to collect some of his effects–every file, cupboard and drawer had been cleared.

Terry Melcher divided his time between acting as executive producer on The Doris Day Show and helping his mother through her darkest depression since her time with Al Jorden. He was also on the board of the Monterey Pop Festival, which he had helped organise back in 1967, and more recently he had become involved with Gram Parsons, the flamboyant, hugely charismatic country-rock singer who had worked with The Byrds and was currently fronting The Flying Burrito Brothers. There is little denying that Terry developed a crush on 22-year-old Gram, who very quickly told him that he was not interested in that kind of a relationship whence they became close friends.

Both Doris and Terry were traumatised when Gram almost died in a motorcycle accident. Terry also owned a powerful machine (which, on his mother’s insistence, had not been taken out of the garage for some time) and Terry had been one of the first to ride pillion on Gram’s new baby, a customised Harley Davidson with coffin-shaped fuel tank and starry-skies bodywork. This was a big bike for a big man and the two friends often roared around Gram’s favourite Mojave Desert location without crash helmets. There,

For a while it was touch and go. Doris and Terry regularly visited him at the nearby St Joseph’s Hospital, where he underwent emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. He remained in hospital for two weeks before he was allowed to return home to the bungalow that he was renting at the Château Marmont complex. Astonishingly, within days he was back on stage with The Flying Burrito Brothers. In the autumn of 1969 it was Gram’s turn to help out his friend when Terry found himself indirectly but dangerously connected to the horrific event that took place at 10050 Cielo Drive. This was the farmhouse built for French movie legend Michele Morgan and more recently purchased by Terry, who lived there

This was where Terry and Gregg Jakobson entered the equation when they agreed to audition Manson and market the songs, should they deem them marketable. Terry, however, had other things on his mind: in December 1968 he split from Candice Bergen, blaming the break-up on pressures heaped on him as he had had to deal with the aftermath of Marty Melcher’s death and declaring, oddly, that he wanted to suffer the pain of loneliness like his mother. He moved out of Cielo Drive and into Doris’ beach house in Malibu, which had somehow been saved from the Receiver. The Cielo Drive property was rented out to Polish film director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate.

Being a hard-headed businessman and impatient with time-wasters, Terry dismissed Manson’s recordings as ‘below average, nothing’, though the real reason for not wanting to work with Manson owed more to the visit to the Spahn Ranch, where he witnessed him losing his temper and almost beating a drunken stuntman to death.

When the police refused to help because he was not an ‘A-class witness’ Terry was forced to hire around-the-clock protection not just for himself, but also for Doris, who feared they might both be kidnapped. The mere fact that Terry had once associated with Manson also earned him a place on the FBI’s ‘Suspicious Persons’ list and he was interrogated at length; Doris, too, it is believed, just in case Terry had revealed any of Manson’s plans to her. Several of the tabloids reported that he was actually a member of the Manson Family and involved in drug trafficking–untrue, of course. One reporter who collared him outside his house asked if the rumour was true that he had fathered several children in the commune, causing him to pull out from his wallet photos of Candice Bergen and other women he had dated and to offer the response,

In the out-take she wears a beautiful pink flowing silk dress and dances with two male partners. For some reason, after viewing the rushes she decided the clip was inappropriate–in her depressive state she temporarily no longer believed in the maxim ‘What will be, will be’–and there was a row with Terry when she demanded it be removed.

Soon after this incident Terry moved to another rented property in Idyllwild, where he distanced himself from all but his very closest friends and lived off a diet of vodka and pills. Doris said at the time that she had been praying for something to happen which would bring him back into her life. Effectively, they were both brought to their senses–Gram Parsons persuaded Terry, very much against Doris’ will to have his motorbike serviced and ‘burn some serious rubber’.

Terry’s slow and painful recovery put he and Doris through the mill. Once the embolisms had been eradicated, the shattered bones in his legs needed to be manipulated back into place and the limbs reconstructed, an immensely traumatic procedure that had to be done without anaesthetic before surgeons could work on him. He remained in hospital off and on for six months while Doris tried her utmost to spend as much time with him as was possible between taping sessions at CBS. Otherwise Alma sat next to his bed while he cursed and raved. His abusive attitude towards his mother and grandmother was a combination of psychosis and cold turkey and anyone else might have given up on him. Doris, however, managed to persuade him to see a mental health specialist–a Dr Head, who offered a ‘double-deal’ and agreed to treat them both. She was still seeing Dr Head on a regular basis as late as 1975 when she published her autobiography. In more lucid moments Terry welcomed visits from friends such as Gram Parsons and members of The

To a certain extent reverting to his old habits calmed his temper tantrums and this was reflected in his attitude towards Doris and Alma, who, once he could get around with a walking frame, insisted on taking him back to Doris’ house, where she had converted one of the guest-rooms into a mini-clinic. She made Terry agree never to get on a motorcycle again, a promise he made with his fingers crossed behind his back. She also gave her other ‘children’–Philip Brown and Todd Starke, from her television show–a stern lecture about the dangers of two-wheel driving. While Brown listened, Starke did not, and Doris was devastated in May 1983 (shortly after declaring herself the happiest woman in the world following the birth of her only grandchild Ryan) to hear that Todd had been killed, aged just 21, in an accident remarkably similar to the one which almost claimed Terry.

Around this time Doris was guest of honour when Terry married at a friend’s house in Rancho Santa Fe. The press was in attendance but all they were really interested in was whether Doris was thinking of tying the knot again–obviously they were referring to her rumoured affair with producer Don Genson. Her response was that she had no intention of heading down the same road as Elizabeth Taylor and Zsa Zsa Gabor, who were jokes, she considered. Her three marriages, she added, had all been mistakes though some good had come out of one of them–Terry. A few months later she observed in her memoirs that if there ever was going to be another man in her life then he would have to be, ‘Someone who will turn me on sexually, but also someone who is as turned on by listening to Joel Goldsmith tapes and reading his books as I am.’ With such aspirations cynics at the time predicted she would probably die an old maid. Of course what they did not know was that she was still seeing her secret lover.

Having never got along with his mother, he elects to move back in with her to resolve their differences. Brooks’ first choice had been long-retired actress Nancy Reagan, who expressed interest but eventually turned down the role for personal reasons–it later emerged that she was nursing husband Ronald through the latter stages of Alzheimer’s. Doris refused the part for no other reason than she had always had a very close relationship with her own son and did not wish anyone to confuse the actress with the character.

After all, in Pillow Talk and almost all of the following Doris Day sex farces (the puerile That Touch of Mink being the notable exception), Doris Day was not so much protecting her virginity—if the character even possessed it to begin with—as testing the man in question to see if he was worthy of her.

If, at various stages of her career, Doris Day represented the idealized career woman, the perfect mother, and the longed-for girl next door, she thereby came to personify the very woman Americans wished they knew, or were. Such a primal response on the audience’s part solidified Day’s specific bond with the American public. It is this special type of personal bond that allows an actor to register with the public not just as a star but as one of the rare breed to make the leap to genuine icon. As longtime Doris Day aficionado John Updike stated, “What do stars mean to us, after all? They’re kind of an indication of what people can be…. There are people up there onscreen who are enacting humanity in their dazzling ways and she was one of them. Even for me she was a kind of directive image…I’d like to be that good.”

The pressure of always being up and happy seems to have gotten to her, and when she collapses in hysterics, one has the slightly discomfiting reaction that Doris Day’s believable but overwrought performance stems from some deep-seated but suppressed hysteria within herself. As she wrote in her autobiography, Day is here remembering the terror of her life with Al Jorden: “I wasn’t acting hysterical, I was hysterical.”

The only similarity between the two lies in Day’s Monroe-like bouffant hairdo. Instead of Marilyn’s palpable vulnerability, Day’s Ellen Arden proves to be another version of her iconic American wife and mother, circa 1963. She is resourceful and energetic, and she certainly drives the comedy. Her chemistry with Garner intact, she has an easy natural rapport with her two screen children and the audience immediately wants this woman to win back her family, even while wondering exactly how Ellen maintained such luxurious false eyelashes and platinum blond hair while stranded on a desert island. Even though Day has a forthright female presence, her vulnerability is genuine; when Nicky’s mother Grace (Thelma Ritter, once again hitting the sauce) tells Ellen that Nicky has remarried, Day’s Ellen looks hurt and in genuine pain. When Ellen sees Nicky for the first time—at the Monterey Hotel, where he is celebrating his honeymoon, no less—it is clear from just one glance that Ellen genuinely loves her husband.

a result, she was blamed for all of the films’ shortcomings. When baby boomers jump-started the sexual revolution, they seemed to blame Doris Day personally for stifling sexuality, completely misreading her films in the process (the simpering Touch of Mink being the one film that unreels guilty as charged). It was a tough load for any individual to shoulder and may very well have contributed to her premature retirement from feature films.

What had become crystal clear by this point in the first season was that whatever success the show enjoyed came about because of the undiminished appeal of Doris Day, and because Doris and her boys actually appeared to be somewhat recognizable human beings—recognizable even if more than a bit idealized. By way of contrast, the villains of each episode were relentlessly cartoonish; in episode eleven, the boys learn that ducks, like all wild creatures, should be allowed to run free and not be harmed by the poacher Tyrone Lovee (Strother Martin).

The first season ends with a truly terrible episode, “The Relatives,” where LeRoy’s cousins visit the Martin farm. Turns out LeRoy is the smart one in the family—a very bad sign. When Doris ends up with scrambled egg all over her face, not to mention hanging on the back of her bedroom door, it’s clear to everyone that a change needs to occur. And fast. Everyone got the message—and quickly, at that—because by season two, Doris had moved to San Francisco, the hillbillies had fled to the hills, and career gal Doris was back in her natural milieu—the big city. This was going to be character-driven comedy about the metropolitan workplace and a lot less claustrophobic than life on the farm. Doris Martin’s life in the second season did not exactly reek of Ernst Lubitsch sophistication, but it sure beat the hell out of chasing pigs around the barnyard.

age difference and one where mother and son became much closer after Terry reached adulthood. By having Terry participate in the documentaries but declining to participate herself, Doris was sending a very clear signal: Her television career was over. The interest on the part of others definitely existed, but not on the part of Day herself. Let other stars play Norma Desmond, yearning for a return to the spotlight. Doris Day wasn’t having any of it, no matter how big the role or offer. As is possible with only the very biggest stars, she had stayed true to her own vision through sheer force of talent and personality. Sixty years into her professional career, in a field where ten years of stardom is considered a good run, she remained internationally famous and a star of the first rank.

Marilyn’s ‘tendency to paranoid reactions.’ At first he thought perhaps, that rather than being schizophrenic, her paranoid tendencies were ‘more masochistic, and an acting out of the orphan-girl rejections … the tendency towards severe depressive reactions, and the impulsive defenses against this, seem to me to be central.’ In the end, after her death, Greenson would describe Marilyn as a woman with ‘extremely weak psychological structures … ego weakness, and certain psychotic manifestations, including those of schizophrenia.’

Looking back at the age of twenty-eight, the former Norma Jeane would say of her husband: ‘He never hurt or upset me, except on one subject. He wanted a baby. The thought of having a baby stood my hair on end. I could see it only as myself, another Norma Jeane in an orphanage. Something would happen to me. I couldn’t explain this to Jim. After he fell asleep, I would lie awake crying. I didn’t quite know who it was that cried, Mrs Dougherty or the child she might have. It was neither. It was Norma Jeane, still alive, still alone, still wishing she were dead.’

Time after time, Marilyn would speak of her longing for children, would make a point of favoring children’s charities and funds for orphans. At her funeral, instead of flowers, donations were directed to children’s hospitals. A children’s clinic in London benefited from a bequest Marilyn made. Yet, in its origins, even this side of Marilyn was a sad confusion.

Marilyn Monroe died childless, by every public account. In 1979 a book by her former maid, Lena Pepitone, contained an assertion that the teenage Norma Jeane had given birth to a child. Few noticed this claim and students of Marilyn suspected Pepitone was merely seeking headlines. Research for this book, however, turned up two other witnesses who said Marilyn spoke to them of having borne a child. According to Pepitone, Marilyn told her story about being molested, but added that the man involved actually had intercourse with her. She became pregnant, but concealed the fact from her guardian for several months. When she did own up to the pregnancy, her guardian saw to it that she had medical attention and arranged for the child to be born in hospital. Pepitone quoted Marilyn as saying, ‘I had the baby … my baby. I was so scared, but it was wonderful. It was a little boy. I hugged him and kissed him. I just kept touching him. I couldn’t believe this was my baby. … But when it was time to leave, the doctor and a nurse came in with Grace [Grace McKee, her guardian]. They all looked real

strange and said they’d be taking the baby. … I begged them, “Don’t take my baby. …” They took my baby from me … and I never saw him again.’ Pepitone said in an interview that Marilyn, on one occasion, said she had never learned what happened to the child; on another, she said she did know and sent regular payments to the California couple who had reared the boy. Pepitone had the impression that the child had been born when Marilyn was about fourteen or fifteen.

Greene, with whom Marilyn lived in 1955, also clearly recalled her saying she gave birth in her teens, let the baby go for adoption, and still felt guilty about it. Former actress Jeanne Carmen, who met Marilyn in the same period as Amy Greene, recalls a similar story with a variation – the baby was born, Marilyn told Carmen, after the marriage to Dougherty and before the real Hollywood breakthrough, when Marilyn was about twenty-one. Carmen said, ‘Marilyn was enormously troubled over this. In one breath she would say, “There’s no God”; then, “Am I going to be punished for giving the baby away?” Desperation was very near the surface.’

she had a ‘tube-tying’ operation in her starlet days, on the advice of an agent who said pregnancy would spell professional failure. Robert Slatzer, who knew Marilyn for most of her adult life, said she later submitted to surgery to have the operation reversed. On top of that, persistent reports from friends suggest Marilyn had numerous abortions. Amy Greene, perhaps the most reliable of those sources, said Marilyn made the horrendous admission that she had had twelve abortions, some of them back-street butcheries dating back to her earliest days in Hollywood. ‘And then,’ said Amy Greene with a sigh, ‘she was surprised when she had trouble having babies. …’ Marilyn’s poor battlefield of a womb had been a torment

Sidney Skolsky, the legendary New York Post writer whose syndicated column on Hollywood could change careers, was headed for the water fountain. He was delayed, though less than irritated, by a shapely behind bent interminably over the fountain. He and the owner of the behind made jokes to each other about the capacity of camels, and ended up having a long conversation. Marilyn poured out the woeful tale of her childhood, and gained a new and influential friend. Except for an interruption during her New York years, Skolsky would remain Marilyn’s confidant till she died.

I hastily went to back out again, but she said to come on in and get my baseball bat and glove.’ Bennett and his eight-year-old sister, Anne, shared a nearby room with bunk beds, and Anne recalled how one day ‘this vision walked in, a beautiful blonde lady.

Nana Karger hoped her son would marry Marilyn. He, meanwhile, was backing off. One night, according to Marilyn, he told her why. ‘It would be all right for me, but I keep thinking of my son. If we were married and anything should happen to me – such as my dropping dead – it would be very bad for him.’ ‘Why?’ Marilyn asked. Karger’s answer was hard. ‘It wouldn’t be right for him to be brought up by a woman like you. It would be unfair to him.’ Marilyn, wounded in the part of her that needed children, tried to leave Karger. For a while they rode that saddest of roller coasters, the breakup that is inevitable, yet seemingly impossible. Marilyn recalled, ‘There was a third and fourth good-bye.

Marilyn Monroe The surgeon, Dr Marcus Rabwin, already knew of his patient’s concern about being able to bear children. There was a small possibility of complications involving the pelvic area, and a gynecologist stood by. This was Dr Leon Krohn, who would henceforth serve Marilyn through most of her long quest to bear children. The operation went smoothly, and the star awoke with only the routine scar. ‘When I told Marilyn she could go home,’ Dr Rabwin recalled, ‘she looked tearful and said, “I can’t because I don’t have the money to pay the hospital bill.” I told her to call the studio; they would do all that. She said, “Do you think they would?” She did call, and of course they had the bill paid and a limousine at the door within an hour.’

There seems no doubt a note did exist; according to one source, it remained in the possession of Paula Strasberg for many years. Miller eventually acknowledged that he might have written such a note. Less than two years after Marilyn’s death, moreover, his controversial play, After the Fall, appeared, drawing heavily on the playwright’s experiences with Marilyn. While it is dangerous to make too much of fiction, Miller did include a scene in which the female protagonist finds an upsetting note.

In 1980, in his autobiography, entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr, wrote of Marilyn: ‘While she was making The Prince and the Showgirl with Laurence Olivier, she was going through one of the most difficult periods of her life. She was having an affair with a close friend of mine. He was a photographer. … They met clandestinely, often at my house. She was always being followed there, and we had to get up all sorts of intrigues to keep the affair secret. I used to pretend we were having a party, and Marilyn would arrive and leave at different times from my pal.’

Olivier’s wife, Vivien Leigh, had long been subject to breakdowns and uncontrollable violent rages. During the shooting of The Prince and the Showgirl, Leigh suffered a miscarriage. Marilyn began vomiting, was attended by the Queen’s obstetrician, and rumors flew around that she too was pregnant.

Marilyn’s union with Arthur Miller was to last four and a half years, the longest full-time relationship of her life. She would one day say ruefully, ‘I was never used to being happy, so that wasn’t something I ever took for granted. I did sort of think you know, marriage did that.’ If ever Marilyn hoped for happiness, and worked at it, it was now. As for Miller, he gave more of his life and love to Marilyn than did any other man. After the

Writing’s such a lonely kind of work.’ Now, more than in the DiMaggio marriage, Marilyn actually did some of these things. ‘Marriage,’ she told one interviewer, ‘makes me feel more womanly, more proud of myself.

Marilyn entered eagerly into the role of stepmother to Jane, Miller’s teenage daughter by his first marriage, and Robert, his nine-year-old son. Soon Marilyn would puzzle Hollywood visitors to the Manhattan apartment by abruptly vanishing during an important meeting. She would return to explain that she ‘had to get the kids off to school.’

Years later she said of Miller’s children and DiMaggio’s son, ‘I take a lot of pride in them, because they’re from broken homes. I think I understand about them. I think I love them more than anyone. I wanted to be their friend. Only time could prove that to them and they had to give me time.’ Marilyn kept in touch with ‘her children’ long after the Miller marriage was over, and their pictures would be found in her room after her death.

For Marilyn-watchers these excursions offered related clues.

In June, in an interview suppressed in her lifetime because the publicity people judged it out of tune with her image, she had said, ‘A man and a woman need something of their own. A baby makes a marriage perfect.’ Within weeks of her thirty-first birthday, and on the eve of her first wedding anniversary, she conceived.

Miller was pleased too. ‘To understand Marilyn best,’ he was to say, ‘you have to see her around children. They love her; her whole approach to life has their kind of simplicity and directness.’ Not entirely in jest, for Miller was a handsome fellow, a wit among their friends had reversed Shaw’s famous reply to Isadora Duncan. ‘How wonderful it would be,’ he exclaimed, ‘if their first child had his looks and her brains!’

Marilyn was to die, five years later, on the anniversary of this miscarriage. At the time Marilyn seemed to rally well. She made a point of reviving an appointment for a champagne party that had been canceled on the day of the miscarriage. The doctors said she could yet bear a child, and Miller declared ‘she wants as many babies as she can have, and I feel the same way. She has more courage than anyone I’ve met.’

There was little secrecy, however, about the marital folly that Marilyn committed in 1960. At nearly thirty-four, after an unhappy idle year, she began to tear apart the faltering marriage to Arthur Miller. The final phase began when she returned to Hollywood for the filming of Let’s Make Love, opposite the French actor Yves Montand.

Greenson also listened to Marilyn’s ‘venomous resentment’ toward Arthur Miller. She claimed her husband was women, and dominated by his mother.

Marilyn did not work at all in 1961. Twice that summer she found herself back in hospital beds, this time for physical ailments. In May, in Los Angeles, there was yet another gynecological operation. Doctors now determined that her Fallopian tubes were blocked, apparently as a result of inept surgery following some earlier abortion.

From now, until she died, Greenson’s wife and two children acted as a virtual foster family for Marilyn. The Greensons lived in a fine Mexican-style house at the summit of the only hill in Santa Monica, and to spare Marilyn needless exposure at his office, Dr Greenson usually received her there. Uncharacteristically, perhaps because Greenson said unpunctuality was a sign of disliking someone, Marilyn started arriving early. Greenson’s daughter Joan, a twenty-one-year-old art student, would greet Marilyn when the doctor was not ready for her, and the two would amble along by the nearby reservoir, gazing out over the city and the Pacific Ocean. For Joan Greenson the experience was unnerving but fascinating. Soon she was visiting the great star at her apartment, driving her around town, and beginning an unusual friendship. Marilyn offered advice about boyfriends, helped with makeup – she showed Joan how to bleach the hair shadowing her upper lip – and the two of them swapped clothes.

Danny Greenson, Joan’s twenty-four-year-old brother, had not expected to get on with Marilyn. He was a student, politically radical by contemporary standards, and he expected ‘a rich Hollywood bitch.’ Instead he found himself drawn to a woman who was ‘in no way put on or artificial, with a real warmth.’ Marilyn, in her black wig, went along with Danny when he was apartment hunting. They talked politics, and he found her sympathetic to his leftist opinions.

Homosexuality was again a factor in Marilyn’s psychiatric treatment that summer. Dr Greenson was seeing Marilyn seven days a week, ‘mainly because she was lonely and had no one to see her, and nothing to do if I didn’t see her.’ He identified two clear problem areas: Marilyn’s obsessive fear of homosexuality and her inability to cope with any sort of hurt.

Before leaving Mexico, Marilyn visited the National Institute for the Protection of Children, which provided for thousands of orphans and deprived youngsters. She had intended to make a donation of $1,000, but then, on impulse, tore up the check and wrote a new one for $10,000. Some reports indicate Marilyn made an application to adopt a Mexican child during her visit. Certainly she would now keep harking back to her own yearning for motherhood, a factor that will shortly take on a grim significance.

‘I’d like to be a complete woman, and have a child,’ Marilyn had said early in the year, during her trip to Mexico. She was still hoping, after all the miscarriages and all the damaging abortions. She went on talking about babies throughout her last months, and seemed to dwell on it in one of her last interviews. In late June she told photo-journalist George Barris, ‘A woman must have to love a man with all her heart to have his child. I mean, especially when she’s not married to him. And when a man leaves a woman when she tells him she’s going to have his baby, when he doesn’t marry her, that must hurt a woman very much, deep down inside.’

‘An American doctor went down to Tijuana to do it,’ Otash asserted, ‘which made Marilyn safe medically, and made the doctor safe from U.S. law.’ Bordertown abortions were commonplace in 1962, when the operation was still illegal in the United States. Ironically, on the day Marilyn died, an American woman would make international news by traveling for an abortion to Sweden, where the operation was legal. There is no medical evidence to support the theory that Marilyn had been pregnant. Her autopsy, on August 5, offered no information one way or the other, but neither a miscarriage nor a properly performed abortion would necessarily leave traces after some weeks had passed. Marilyn’s phone records do show that she was placing calls to Cedars-Sinai Hospital during June, which may or may not be significant.

On Wednesday that week, gynecologist Dr Leon Krohn played a round of golf at the Hillcrest Golf Course. It was his day off, and he was irritated when summoned to the clubhouse for an urgent call. It came from Marilyn, whom he had last treated years earlier, shortly before her miscarriage at the end of Some Like It Hot. At that time Marilyn had stamped off in a temper over his warnings that she stay away from drugs and alcohol, and to take it easy if she wanted to have her baby. Now, calling out of the blue, Marilyn asked, ‘Are you still angry with me – about the baby?’ Nonplussed, the doctor assured her he was not. Marilyn wanted to see Krohn as soon as possible. They agreed to have dinner, but Marilyn was to die before they could meet. Was Marilyn mourning her unborn children?

At 7:40 P.M. Marilyn called Dr Greenson, now busy shaving. He was glad to hear her sounding more cheerful: Joe, Jr.’s news had been that he had broken off his engagement, and that pleased Marilyn. Dr Greenson told her to get a good night’s sleep and to call in the morning.

The Suicide Prevention Team would conclude that Marilyn had been receiving Nembutal prescriptions from both Dr Engelberg and from a Dr Lou Siegel, and that neither doctor knew of her visits to the other. Dr Lou Siegel, a gynecologist who has since died, vehemently denied in 1982 that he had ever treated Marilyn. Dr Lee Siegel, the studio doctor who did frequently treat Marilyn, says he did not see her for many weeks prior to her death.

Skeptics have also noted that no drinking glass was found in Marilyn’s bedroom, and no water – she would surely have needed water to wash down all those pills. In short, their suspicion has been that somebody else administered Marilyn’s fatal dose – that she was murdered. The absence of a drinking glass is curious.

In the fickle century that invented ‘stardom,’ only Charlie Chaplin was memorialized and chronicled more than Marilyn Monroe, a fact that would probably amaze and amuse her. Fittingly, Marilyn’s brittle, too-long laughter follows us down the decades of an era that some call the Age of Anxiety. In that odd telegram to Robert Kennedy, weeks before she died, she described herself as one of the few remaining earth-bound stars. ‘All we demanded,’ Marilyn said in the telegram, ‘was our right to twinkle.’ She more than earned that right, and Everyman has made her a goddess.

Oh Bobby, guess what. I had dinner last night with the Attorney General of the United States, Robert Kennedy, and I asked him what his department was going to do about Civil Rights and some other issues. He is very intelligent, and besides all that, he’s got a terrific sense of humor. I think you would like him. Anyway, I had to go to this dinner last night as he was the guest of honor and when they asked him who he wanted to meet, he wanted to meet me. So I went to the dinner and I sat next to him, and he isn’t a bad dancer either. But I was mostly impressed about how serious he is about Civil Rights. He answered all of my questions and then he said he would write me a letter and put it on paper. So, I’ll send you a copy of the letter when I get it because there will be some very interesting things in it, because I really asked many questions. First of all he asked if I had been attending some kind of meetings (ha ha!).

I was commissioned to write a short article on the case, and I traveled to California. I soon realized it would be pointless to tackle the death issue without long research.

Today, a marriage based on mutual respect and commitment is a wonderful thing for both partners and for any children they have. But a bad marriage is often worse than singlehood for the health and well-being of most family members. Insisting, as Justice Kennedy does, that marriage is essential to fulfill “our most profound hopes” makes it difficult for society to respond to the needs—or recognize the contributions—of the growing number of singles and unmarried couples in America. It may also encourage people to expect too great a transformation in their well-being from getting married, while frightening or stigmatizing those who have

This is certainly true of the most atypical family system in American history, the post–World War II male-breadwinner family that is the subject of chapter 2. It is easy to understand why many people harbor nostalgia for the 1950s. Job security—at least for white men—was far greater than it has been for the past forty years. Decent housing was much more affordable for a single-earner family. Unlike in recent decades, real wages were rising for the bottom 70 percent of the population as well as for the top earners, and income inequality was falling.

Psychiatrists in that era insisted that the “normal” woman found complete fulfillment by renouncing her personal aspirations and identifying with her husband’s achievements. Something was badly wrong, they warned, if a woman or man “usurped” any rights or duties belonging to the other sex. In movies and on TV, you could generally tell that a family was seriously dysfunctional if the man was shown washing dishes or—worse yet—running a vacuum cleaner.31

Like most visions of a “golden age,” the “traditional family” my students describe evaporates on closer examination. It is an ahistorical amalgam of structures, values, and behaviors that never coexisted in the same time and place. The notion that traditional families fostered intense intimacy between husbands and wives while creating mothers who were totally available to their children, for example, is an idea that combines some characteristics of the white, middle-class family in the mid-nineteenth century and some of a rival family ideal first articulated in the 1920s.

Studies of marital satisfaction reveal that more couples reported their marriages to be happy in the late 1970s than did so in 1957, while couples in their second marriages believe them to be much happier than their first ones. Some commentators conclude that marriage is becoming less permanent but more satisfying. Others wonder, however, whether there is a vicious circle in our country, where no one even tries to sustain a relationship.

Part of the problem in making simple generalizations about what is happening to marriage is that there has been a polarization of experiences. Marriages are much more likely to be ended by divorce today, but marriages that do last are described by their participants as happier than those in the past and are far more likely to confer such happiness over many years. It is important to remember that the 50 percent divorce rate estimates are calculated in terms of a forty-year period and that many marriages in the past were terminated well before that date by the death of one partner. Historian Lawrence Stone suggests that divorce has become “a functional substitute for death” in the modern world. At the end of the 1970s, the rise in divorce rates seemed to overtake the fall in death rates, but the slight decline in divorce rates since then means that “a couple marrying today is more likely to celebrate a fortieth wedding anniversary than were couples around

For people overwhelmed by the difficulties of adjusting work and schools to the realities of working moms, it has been tempting to discern a “return to tradition” and hope the problems will go away.

The chance that a woman will reach age forty without ever having married has increased substantially since the 1950s. But the chance that a woman who postpones marriage will eventually marry has also increased substantially. A never-married woman over thirty-five has a better chance to marry today than she did in the 1950s. In the past twelve years, first-time marriages have increased almost 40 percent for women aged thirty-five to thirty-nine. A single woman aged forty to forty-four still has a 24 percent probability of marriage, while 15 percent of women in their late forties will marry. These figures would undoubtedly be higher if many women over forty did not simply pass up opportunities that a more desperate generation might have snatched.26 Yet another example

Despite humane intentions, an overemphasis on personal responsibility for strengthening family values encourages a way of thinking that leads to moralizing rather than mobilizing for concrete reforms. While values are important to Americans, most do not support the sort of scapegoating that occurs when all family problems are blamed on “bad values.” Most of us are painfully aware that there is no clear way of separating “family values” from “the system.” Our values may make a difference in the way we respond to the challenges posed by economic and political institutions, but those institutions also reinforce certain values

The 1950s was a pro-family period if there ever was one. Rates of divorce and illegitimacy were tiny compared to today; marriage was almost universally praised; the family was everywhere hailed as the most basic institution in society; and a massive baby boom, among all classes and ethnic groups, made America a “child-centered” society. Births rose from a low of 18.4 per 1,000 women during the Depression to a high of 25.3 per 1,000 in 1957. “The birth rate for third children doubled between 1940 and 1960, and that for fourth children tripled.”2 In retrospect, the 1950s

Housing starts exploded after the war, peaking at 1.65 million in 1955 and remaining above 1.5 million a year for the rest of the decade; the increase in single-family homeownership between 1946 and 1956 outstripped the increase during the entire preceding century and a half. By 1960, 62 percent of American families owned their own homes, in contrast to 43 percent in 1940. Eighty-five percent of the new homes were built in the suburbs, where the nuclear family found new possibilities for privacy and togetherness.

Cultural historian David Marc argues that prewar fantasies of sophisticated urban “elegance,” epitomized by the high-rise penthouse apartment, gave way in the 1950s to a more modest vision of utopia: a single-family house and a car. The emotional dimensions of utopia, however, were unbounded. When respondents to a 1955 marriage study “were asked what they thought they had sacrificed by marrying and raising a family, an overwhelming majority of them replied, ‘Nothing.’” Less than 10 percent of Americans believed that an unmarried person could be happy. As one popular advice book intoned, “The family is the center of your living. If it isn’t, you’ve gone far astray.”6

At the time, most people understood the 1950s family to be a new invention. The Great Depression and World War II had reinforced extended family ties, but in ways that were experienced by most people as stultifying and oppressive. As one child of the Depression later put it, The Waltons television series of the 1970s did not show what family life in the 1930s was really like: “It wasn’t a big family sitting around a table radio and everybody saying goodnight while Bing Crosby crooned ‘Pennies from Heaven.’” On top of Depression-era family tensions had come the painful family separations and housing shortages of the war years: By

Talcott Parsons and other sociologists argued that modern industrial society required the family to jettison traditional productive functions and wider kin ties in order to specialize in emotional nurturance, childrearing, and production of a modern personality. Social workers “endorsed nuclear family separateness and looked suspiciously on active extended-family networks.”9 Popular commentators urged young families to adopt a “modern” stance and strike out on their own, and with the return of prosperity, most did.

Historian Peter Biskind writes that almost every major male star who had played tough loners in the 1930s and 1940s “took the roles with which he was synonymous and transformed them, in the fifties, into neurotics or psychotics.” In these films, “men belonged at home, not on the streets or out on the prairie, . . . not alone or hanging out with other men.” The women who got men to settle down had to promise enough sex to compete with “bad” women, but ultimately they provided it only in the marital bedroom and only in return for some help fixing up the house.13

The “good life” in the 1950s, historian Clifford Clark points out, made the family “the focus of fun and recreation.” The ranch house, architectural embodiment of this new ideal, discarded the older privacy of the kitchen, den, and sewing room (representative of separate spheres for men and women) but introduced new privacy and luxury into the master bedroom. There was an unprecedented “glorification of self-indulgence” in family life. Formality was discarded in favor of “livability,” “comfort,” and “convenience.” A contradiction in terms in earlier periods, “the sexually charged, child-centered family took its place at the center of the postwar American dream.”15

Television, comments historian Ella Taylor, increasingly ignored cultural diversity, adopting “the motto ‘least objectionable programming,’ which gave rise to those least objectionable families, the Cleavers, the Nelsons and the Andersons.” Such families were so completely white and Anglo-Saxon that even the Hispanic gardener in Father Knows Best went by the name of Frank Smith.

The happy, homogeneous families that we “remember” from the 1950s were thus partly a result of the media’s denial of diversity. But even among sectors of the population where the “least objectionable” families did prevail, their values and behaviors were not entirely a spontaneous, joyful reaction to prosperity. If suburban ranch houses and family barbecues were the carrots offered to white middle-class families that adopted the new norms, there was also a stick. Women’s retreat to housewifery, for example, was in many cases not freely chosen. During the war, thousands of women had entered new jobs, gained new skills, joined unions, and fought against job discrimination. Although 95 percent of the new women employees had expected when they were first hired to quit work at the end of the war, by 1945 almost an equally overwhelming majority did not want to give up their independence, responsibility, and income, and expressed the desire to continue working.23 After the war, however,

Vehement attacks were launched against women who did not accept such self-definitions. In the 1947 bestseller The Modern Woman: The Lost Sex, Marynia Farnham and Ferdinand Lundberg described feminism as a “deep illness,” called the notion of an independent woman a “contradiction in terms,” and accused women who sought educational or employment equality of engaging in symbolic “castration” of men. As sociologist David Riesman noted, a woman’s failure to bear children went from being “a social disadvantage and sometimes a personal tragedy” in the nineteenth century to being a “quasi-perversion” in

the 1950s. The conflicting messages aimed at women seemed almost calculated to demoralize: At the same time as they labeled women “unnatural” if they did not seek fulfillment in motherhood, psychologists and popular writers insisted that most modern social ills could be traced to domineering mothers who invested too much energy and emotion in their children. Women were told that “no other experience in life . . . will provide the same sense of fulfillment, of happiness, of complete pervading contentment” as motherhood. But soon after delivery they were asked, “Which are you first of all, Wife or Mother?” and warned against the tendency to be “too much mother, too little wife.”

successful 1950s family, moreover, was often achieved at enormous cost to the wife, who was expected to subordinate her own needs and aspirations to those of both her husband and her children. In consequence, no sooner was the ideal of the postwar family accepted than observers began to comment perplexedly on how discontented women seemed in the very roles they supposedly desired most. In 1949, Life magazine reported that “suddenly and for no plain reason” American women were “seized with an eerie restlessness.” Under a “mask of placidity” and an outwardly feminine appearance, one physician wrote in 1953, there was often “an inwardly tense and emotionally unstable individual seething with hidden aggressiveness and resentment.”42 Some women took this resentment out on their families.

Other women tried to dull the pain with alcohol or drugs. Tranquilizers, originally developed for hard-charging businessmen, soon became the go-to treatment for “housewife’s syndrome.” Consumption of “mother’s little helper” pills soared from 462,000 to 1.15 million pounds between 1958 and 1959. Commentators noted a sharp increase in women’s drinking during the decade, even though many middle-class housewives kept their liquor stash hidden and thought no one knew that they needed a couple of drinks to face an evening of family “togetherness.”43

Happy memories of 1950s family life are not all illusion, of course—there were good times for many families. But even the most positive aspects had another side.

A surprising number of these births were illegitimate, although 1950s census codes made it impossible to identify an unmarried mother if she lived at home with her parents. The incidence of illegitimacy was also disguised by the new emphasis on “rehabilitating” the white mother (though not the black) by putting her baby up for adoption and encouraging her to “start over”: There was an 80 percent increase in the number of out-of-wedlock babies placed

Authors such as those just mentioned want to return to a traditional family that antedates the 1950s family by more than one hundred years, reviving the Victorian notion of separate spheres for men and women. In the nineteenth-century middle-class family, a much more rigid division of labor between men and women prevailed than in the 1950s: Women were legally excluded, for example, from the vote, from professional training, and from most colleges. In the absence of a consumer culture and the modern mass media, the Victorian domestic family was extremely resistant to materialism, consumerism, and sexual eroticism.

Mothers were considered the moral guardians of civilization itself. Men had no doubt that they themselves were both the protectors and the representatives of their families in relation to the outside world as well as the ultimate source of authority in the household.

In this chapter, I demonstrate that female domesticity and male individualism developed together, as an alternative to more widely dispersed social bonds, emotional ties, and material interdependencies. Consequently, attempting to reimpose domesticity on women without rethinking the role of individualism in our economy and polity would only re-create the same tensions that undermined the Victorian family in the first place.

Women began to romanticize love and nurturing as female qualities that compensated for, or even outweighed, men’s political power and economic resources. Men began to romanticize women as givers of services and emotions that could not be bought on the open market or claimed as political tribute but seemed to flow from generosity and self-sacrifice rather than from calculation or exchange.

This tendency of capitalist and republican ideology to romanticize family life and gender differentiation was reinforced by the crisis of political obligation in the liberal state, which could no longer claim divine right to absolute obedience yet increasingly disavowed its right to enforce cooperation for some greater good. Social contract theory accords the state legitimacy only for as long as it provides security of individuals’ lives and property.

empathy, personalism, and tenderness.36 Historian Barbara Welter has summed up the definition of “True Womanhood” that emerged in America in the first few decades of the nineteenth century: “piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity. Put them all together and they spelled mother, daughter, sister, wife—woman.” As mother, daughter, sister, and wife, woman cared for son, father, brother, and husband. Yet in order to give this care, she also depended on the economic support of such men. Thus, as political scientist Virginia Sapiro notes, women were defined as dependents because everyone else was dependent on them. As men shed their social identities and embraced individualism and self-reliance, collectivism and dependence were frequently imposed on women.

As Berger puts it, the lover searches “for one single person to represent all that he is not, to confront him as his other half and his opposite” and thus to “make the world complete for him.”45 But he must also make the world complete for her by being all that she is not.

Women, of course, face the same problem: The more successfully they attract a lover to their ideal gender qualities, the more they must suppress those aspects of their personality that do not fit the ideal. Each person loses his or her own half in the process of attracting “the other half.”

For a woman, the process of falling in love is not so much a loss of control as it is a socially acceptable way of exploring her own powers, challenging herself, finding the simultaneous transcendence and self-absorption that men find in work. But even at the height of love, and especially after marriage, women find nothing “mysterious” about feelings. Emotions are women’s work; the home is the place where most of that work takes place.

The more women are defined in terms of an ideal myth, for example, the more possible it is for men to ignore or actively abuse women who do not meet that ideal. Thus in the nineteenth century, the cult of True Womanhood was perfectly compatible with the exploitation of female slaves and factory workers. In the twentieth century, a recurring theme in rape and sexual harassment cases has been the notion that if a woman has ever departed from ideal behavior in any way, she has no real “womanhood” to be violated or offended.

Another oft-cited example of familial self-reliance is the improvement in living standards experienced by many Americans during the 1950s. The surge in homeownership at that time, most people believe, occurred because families scraped together down payments, paid their mortgages promptly, raised their children to respect private property, and always “stood on their own two feet.” An entire generation of working people thereby attained middle-class status, graduating from urban tenements to suburban homeownership, just as Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz did in their television series.

Before World War II, banks often required a 50 percent down payment on homes and normally issued mortgages for only five to ten years. In the postwar period, however, the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), supplemented by the GI Bill, put the federal government in the business of insuring and regulating private loans for single-home construction. FHA policy required down payments of only 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price and guaranteed mortgages of up to thirty years at interest rates of just 2 to 3 percent on the balance.

There has been an acceleration of urban deterioration, social decay, and family breakup in the past two decades, a process discussed in chapters 10 and 11. But the claim that rising welfare subsidies caused this is not upheld by the facts. Although both single-mother families and the rolls of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) have expanded since the mid-1950s, for example, these trends should be understood as separate responses to other socioeconomic and cultural changes, for there is no causal relationship between welfare benefits and single-parent families

The image of teenage girls having babies to receive welfare checks is an emotion-laden but fraudulent cliché. If the availability of welfare benefits causes teen pregnancy, why is it that other industrial countries, with far more generous support policies for women and children, have far lower rates of teen pregnancy?33 Welfare benefits do seem to increase the likelihood of unmarried teen mothers moving away from their parents’ households, hence increasing the visibility of these mothers, but they bear little or no relation to actual birthrates for unmarried women. Harvard economists David Ellwood and Mary Jo Bane compared unmarried women who would be eligible for welfare if they had an illegitimate child with unmarried women who would not be eligible: Even by confining their analysis to states that gave the most generous welfare benefits to single mothers, they found no difference in the rates of illegitimacy between the groups.

Until the early 1960s, state policy continued to be unambiguously aimed at protection of a family package very much like that advocated by antistate, pro-family conservatives today: paternal breadwinning; maternal domesticity; prolonged childhood; repression of female sexuality; and an equation of family privacy with free enterprise, Americanism, and patriotism. This family pattern, remarks historian Linda Gordon, “is not ‘traditional,’ as is often claimed today, but was new when child protection originated. Indeed, child protection was part of the efforts to enforce this arrangement.”46 To

The right wing is more vitriolic. According to psychologist Edward Hoffman, the eight years after 1966 saw a permissive “values upheaval” that replaced “pro-child and pro-family attitudes . . . with a cluster of social values that may aptly be called Personal Liberation Ideology.” The epicenter of this earthquake was feminism’s insistence on careers and its devaluation of motherhood. Feminists adopted a conscious “strategy” of tearing down the “social and moral order” favoring family ties, in order to install a value system based solely on individual fulfillment in the workplace and leading inevitably to child neglect.4

Prior to Betty Friedan’s 1963 bestseller, The Feminine Mystique, according to a recent account that echoes the historical sense if not the value judgment of almost every student I have ever asked to draw a time line of modern life, “the largest proportion of middle-class women on this continent were living in peace in what they considered to be a normal, traditional, worthwhile lifestyle.” Life, as one right-wing author puts it, “has never been the same since.” Demoralized by feminists’ “constant disparagement of mother’s work,” thousands of women walked away from their relationships and threw themselves into careers. The acquisitive, competitive values women adopted when they forsook domesticity led them to become “clones” of men. Even many former feminists now say that the movement “went

The effect of the Depression was to decrease the “taste” of married women for paid work. The Depression temporarily expanded the value and amount of women’s household work, reducing the relative returns of full-time employment, not to mention the time available for it. Concurrently, the cultural prejudices against married working women and the undesirable nature of their jobs made work seem an act of desperation rather than a free choice. Many women who began their families in the 1940s and 1950s associated their mothers’ employment during the 1930s with economic hardship and family failure. They looked forward to establishing a different pattern in their own marriages.22 A major reason that married women failed to develop a strong commitment to the labor force prior to World War II was the powerful role of sexual stereotypes in pay and promotion from 1900 to 1940. Indeed, the creation of a segregated women’s sector of the economy (as opposed to segregated jobs within the same workplace) occurred during this time.

Between 1940 and 1945, the female labor force increased by more than 50 percent: Three-fourths of the new female workers were married, and a majority were mothers of school-age children. Government spearheaded a large and rapid shift in attitudes toward the employment of married women and mothers. The state also financed child care for mothers working in defense industries. At their peak, these centers served 1.5 million children, more than were in all other kinds of day care combined as late as 1974. The war eliminated many barriers to the employment of wives, mothers, and older women. It also gave thousands of women who had already been working their first experience of occupational mobility and the rewards of challenging, well-paid work.24

There was an almost universal reimposition of sexual segregation and pay differentials by companies after the war. Working women were also the target of vehement attacks by academics, professionals, and politicians. Such setbacks interacted with pent-up desires of both women and men to start a family, producing an idealization of family life that may have slowed down and certainly concealed the steady rise in the number of married women workers.26

At first glance, the 1950s represented a reassertion of female domesticity. But single women’s employment rose rapidly, and the postwar baby boom merely created a backlog of supply-and-demand pressures that unleashed an explosion of employment among married women as the decade progressed. As large numbers of men remained in the military and new consumer industries mushroomed, demand for women workers outstripped the supply, leading to a rise in real wages in women’s jobs and a relaxation of barriers to women’s work. By the end of the decade, 40 percent of all women over the age of sixteen held a job. Growing numbers of these women stated that they were working for self-esteem and personal fulfillment as well as for

Ironically, the young women who chose early marriage, domesticity, and increased fertility in the postwar years, departing from their own mothers’ tendency to prolong education or work before marriage, contributed both to the growing demand for married women in the labor market and eventually to its supply. A tremendous expansion of women’s jobs in clerical work, teaching, nursing, and retail sales occurred after the war. Yet the postwar marriage boom, on top of the Depression fertility drop, decreased the supply of single women to fill these vacancies. Consequently, employers changed their hiring practices to accommodate

This trivialization paved the way for feminism among the same middle-class educated women who had led the postwar family boom. In 1957, a Smith College survey of its graduates found that the homemakers who responded “resented the wide disparity between the idealized image society held of them as housewives and mothers and the realities of their daily routines.” A study of younger women who graduated from college between 1945 and 1955 revealed that the full-time housewives in the sample suffered from lower self-esteem, more fears about aging, and greater insecurity about their child-raising skills than did the employed women. Friedan, in her 1963 bestseller, did not cause homemakers’ self-doubt and discontent; she merely put together the Smith College Survey data to generalize about “the feminine mystique” that enveloped many women and left them so unsure of their own identity.38 It was not the campus activists of the 1960s but their mothers who initiated the women’s movement.

The real takeoff of consumer culture, though, like the expansion of married women’s employment, began during the 1950s. Advertising increased by 400 percent between 1945 and 1960, a growth rate faster than that of the GNP. As motivational researcher Ernest Dichter explained advertising’s aim, “We are now confronted with the problem of permitting the average American to feel moral . . . even when he is taking two vacations a year and buying a second or third car. One of the basic problems of prosperity, then, is to demonstrate that the hedonistic approach to life is a moral, not an immoral one.”54

The 1950s family, supposedly the peak of tradition, was in many ways simply the “wrapper” for an extension of commodity production to new areas of life, an extension that paved the way for the commercialization of love and sex so often blamed on the 1960s. The “wholesome” television serials that some people confuse in memory with actual 1950s life were early attempts to harness mass entertainment to sales of goods. With only three to five channels for viewers to choose from, a show that hoped to be competitive had to attract approximately 30 percent of all viewers. Consequently, advertisers favored shows that presented “universal themes” embodied in homogenized families without serious divisions of interest by age, gender, income, or ethnic group. The hope was that everyone could identify with these families and hence with the mass-produced appliances that were always shown in conjunction with the mass-produced sentiments: Ozzie and Harriet, for example, had some of their most heartwarming talks in front of the Hotpoint kitchen appliances that the show was supposed to help sell.65 Once

Clapping back on negative narratives cannot be the sole responsibility of minorities, or people of colour; it lies on the shoulders of all allies and those who want to stand up for the rights of the underrepresented, but don’t feel knowledgeable enough to challenge and dispel the stereotypes perpetuated by people who look and sound like them.

Most of these people are known as the ‘Windrush generation’ after the ship, the Empire Windrush, which brought many Caribbean people to Britain in 1948 – more on them in Chapter Eleven. But the very idea that the Home Office thought it appropriate to deport a resident, born in the UK, is indicative of the false idea that a British citizen has to fit a specific race, language, culture or heritage – and why this stereotype is harmful.

For the record, it is perfectly ok to call someone who is black, black. We don’t find it offensive, if anything, it is a label of pride. But, if colour is not a determinant of whether you are black or not, then what? The acclaimed actor, Denzel Washington, would suggest it is culture. Denzel directed the 2016 movie, Fences, about a black family trying to get by in 1950s Pittsburgh – which was an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name by August Wilson. In 1990, Wilson penned an essay making it clear that he’d only allow a black director to bring the play to life on the big screen.

One instance of note was in 2012, when a Hungarian far-right politician with strong ties to anti-Semitism discovered that he was actually Jewish. Csanad Szegedi was the deputy leader of a radical nationalist Jobbik party in Hungary, who blamed Jewish people for what he perceived as the ills of Hungarian society. In fact, Szegedi co-founded the Hungarian Guard – a paramilitary formation that marched in uniform through Roma neighbourhoods. Upon realising his heritage, he has now become a devout Orthodox Jew, and has visited Israel, and the concentration camp at Auschwitz which his own grandmother survived. This shows the dynamic and fluid nature of what we consider as ‘where we are from’, or even ‘who we are’.

It’s been scientifically proven that life began in Africa, but around 100,000 years ago, people started to migrate out and occupy the rest of the world. Those that remained in Africa evolved to have dark skin for protection against the harsh ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and those that migrated to the northern latitudes evolved pale skin, the better to produce vitamin D from softer sunlight. It’s funny isn’t it; the fact that the colour of our skin, which determines so much about us and how we are treated, boils down to nothing more than simply being a consequence of ultraviolet light.

For example, after Jesse Owens’s record-breaking performances at the 1936 Olympics, the then US United States Olympic team’s sprint coach, Dean Cromwell wrote in his book, ‘The Negro excels. It was not long ago that his ability to sprint and jump was a life-and-death matter to him in the jungle.12 His muscles are pliable, and his easy-going disposition is a valuable aid to the mental and physical relaxation that a runner and jumper must have.’ Here we see how something that is initially viewed as a positive stereotype has its roots in racism.

As the Los Angeles Times writer, Jill Leovy, argues in her book, Ghettoside, the law has always existed to help people solve disputes without them taking matters into their own hands and solving it with violence. Black communities haven’t had the luxury of the police being on their side and having them solve disputes, and as mentioned earlier, when the police overstep their bounds, there are no repercussions. As such, black communities rely on their own form of justice, which can lead to high homicide and violent crime rates.

We really did have customers in those early days—true visionary early adopters—and we often talked to them and asked for their feedback. But we emphatically did not do what they said. We viewed their input as only one source of information about our product and overall vision. In fact, we were much more likely to run experiments on our customers than we were to cater to their whims.

The concept of entrepreneurship includes anyone who works within my definition of a startup: a human institution designed to create new products and services under conditions of extreme uncertainty. That means entrepreneurs are everywhere and the Lean Startup approach can work in any size company, even a very large enterprise, in any sector or industry.

Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.

Products change constantly through the process of optimization, what I call tuning the engine. Less frequently, the strategy may have to change (called a pivot). However, the overarching vision rarely changes. Entrepreneurs are committed to seeing the startup through to that destination. Every setback is an opportunity for learning how to get where they want to go (see the chart below). In real life, a startup is a portfolio of activities. A lot is happening simultaneously: the engine is running, acquiring new customers and serving existing ones; we are tuning, trying to improve our product, marketing, and operations; and we are steering, deciding if and when to pivot. The challenge of entrepreneurship is to balance all these activities. Even the smallest startup faces the challenge of supporting existing customers while trying to innovate. Even the most established company faces the imperative to invest in innovation lest it become obsolete. As

The quantitative targets created the motivation to engage in qualitative inquiry and guided us in the questions we asked; this is a pattern we’ll see throughout this book. I wish I could say that I was the one to realize our mistake and suggest the solution, but in truth, I was the last to admit the problem. In short, our entire strategic analysis of the market was utterly wrong. We figured this out empirically, through experimentation, rather than through focus groups or market research. Customers could not tell us what they wanted; most, after all, had never heard of 3D avatars. Instead, they revealed the truth through their action or inaction as we struggled to make the product better.

Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version: Answer premortem* questions: What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail? Communicate with stakeholders: Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters. Define success criteria: What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for? Have an official kickoff: Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project!
